# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview


Our goal for this project is to analyze rideshare data for PyBer, and produce some data visulation that helps the CEO, V. Isualize, understand the relationship between city types and weekly fares. The dataset includes all rides by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban) from January to early May of 2019. In order to perform the analysis, we will be working with Python's pandas and matplotlib within Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

* Urban cities rack up the highest total fares along with the most drivers, and it's not even close.
* This can likely be attributed to the discepency in population density, along with higher demand for long-distance travels given the tendency for rural areas to be spread out.
* You could double the amount of drivers in both rural and suburban areas, and they still wouldn't surpass the heap in Urban cities.
* Rural cities work very efficiently yeilding the highest fare per driver.
* Rural cities ask their drivers to work the most yielding the most rides per driver.
* Rural cities employ just a quarter of what urban cities have in terms of drivers.
* Suburban city drivers makes more than double of those in urban areas.
* Urban cities are the only type to average less than 1 ride per driver.
* Ridesharing is utilized 1300% more in Urban areas than in rural, but drivers make $10 less per ride.
