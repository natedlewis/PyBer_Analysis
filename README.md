# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview


Our goal for this project is to analyze rideshare data for PyBer, and produce some data visulation that helps the CEO, V. Isualize, understand the relationship between city types and weekly fares. The dataset includes all rides by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban) from January to early May of 2019. In order to perform the analysis, we will be working with Python's pandas and matplotlib within Jupyter Notebook.
